Challenge: Seven Boom!
This coding challenge, sourced from Edabit, is of moderate difficulty and tests fundamental skills in JavaScript programming.

Difficulty Level:
Moderate

Source:
This challenge can be found on Edabit.

Objective:
The objective of this challenge is to create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns "Boom!" if the digit 7 appears in any of the numbers within the array. If the digit 7 is not found in any of the numbers, the function returns "there is no 7 in the array".

Techniques Used:
Array manipulation
Iteration using loops
Conditional logic with ternary expressions
Utilization of array methods (includes() or some())
Regular expressions (optional, depending on the implementation)

Logic:
Define a function sevenBoom that takes an array arr as its parameter.
Use array methods or loops to iterate through each element in the array.
For each element, check if it contains the digit 7.
If the digit 7 is found in any of the elements, return "Boom!".
If the digit 7 is not found in any of the elements, return "there is no 7 in the array".

Example Usage:

sevenBoom([8, 6, 33, 100]); // Returns "there is no 7 in the array" 

sevenBoom([2, 55, 60, 97, 86]); // Returns "Boom!"


Conclusion:
This coding challenge tests proficiency in JavaScript fundamentals such as array manipulation, loops, conditional logic, and familiarity with array methods. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate problem-solving skills and understanding of basic programming techniques.
